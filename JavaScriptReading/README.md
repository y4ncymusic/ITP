Chapter 1:
I already knew: quotes matter → text ≠ numbers
I didn’t know: logical operators can choose values, not just true/false

Chapter 2:
I already knew：When a binding points at a value, that does not mean it is tied to that value forever.
I didn’t know:Having the looping condition produce false is not the only way a loop can finish. The break statement has the effect of immediately jumping out of the enclosing loop.

Chapter 3:
I already knew: （it’s all kind of new for me)
I didn’t know:The inner function find does the actual recursing. It takes two arguments: the current number and a string that records how we reached this number. If it finds a solution, it returns a string that shows how to get to the target. If it can find no solution starting from this number, it returns null.
